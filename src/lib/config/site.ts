    // bio: "I'm an engineer who's quite passionate in just about everything in the world. This includes mechanical engineering, software engineering, machine learning, human-computer interaction, design theory, cognitive psychology, 3D graphics, origami, musical instruments, spatial audio, and photography. In free time, I watch DW Documentary, lie down in bed thinking about things, write, plan out the coming weeks, and majestically procrastinate while doom-scrolling through Instagram. Thanks for visiting - and always feel free to reach out! Let's grab coffee and talk."
